                            On my Honor: I _________________, pledge to stand for that which is right. I desire to talk and work with others in an effort to show kindness and respect to all I come in contact with. I Seek First to Understand, Then to Be UnderstoodÂ® - Habit 5, FranklinCovey.com. I can try harder, will accept constructive criticism from others, and commit to do better. I must do my best to remain civil and encourage others to do the same. I will use my sphere of influence to de-escalate from contentious situations, and will do all I can to encourage civility in all my interactions both in public and in private. I realize that I can remain  true to myself and still show kindness to others. I understand that my respect for others does not in any way mean I agree with all they say or do, but rather that I simply give respect to get respect. I can agree to disagree while being agreeable.
